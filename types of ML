#types of Machine learning ->

1. Supervised learning 
2. Unsupervised learning 
3. Reinforcement learning 
Supervised Learning-> In supervised learning we have labelled data which means already know about input and output  .  
we have to only processed the data and based on the input and output .

supervised learning divides in to two parts-
1-> classification                 2 -> Regression 

In classification we have to judge only two factors either true or false,means binary digit,
failed or passed . that means we are categorized in to two parts ,either this or that.  continous value .

Algorithm  used in Classification ->

1. Naive bayes Algorithm
2. Support vector machine (SVM)
3. Decision tree 
4. Logistic Regression 

Regression ->  In regression algorithm, we predict the output . we can not judge what's the exactly output . it can be something .: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value.

Algorithm used in Regression ->

1. Linear Regression 
2. Logistic regression

Unsupervised Learning ->  In unsupervised learning , we have data in the from only input .or we can say unlabelled data. 
we have to predict the model based on the input basis .

basically divides in to two parts.->
1. clustering 
2. Assosciation 

Algorithm used in unsupervised ->

1. K-means clustering
2.Hierarchical clustering
3.Apriori algorithms
