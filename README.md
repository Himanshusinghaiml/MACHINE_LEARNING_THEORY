# Machine_learning
suppose we write ,two lines codes in c++or any language .

#include<iostream>
int main()
{ int a=10;
int b=20;
cout<<" the sum of two number : "<< (a+b)<<endl;
}


these two lines code only sum for two numbers but once again you trained the model on the dataset then whatever user gives the input, machine automatically response 
any other random number .
(here the concepts comes of machine learning ).....because we have not time again and again to change the code.that's why industry use machine learning .
these two lines code only add two number .if we give more numbers to add the numbers then we have to change the logic and have to write the code .


but in machine learning once again you predict  the model  with 100 accuracy .then no need to change anything. and you can  give either 2,10,1000,30000 anythng random,they calculate .
